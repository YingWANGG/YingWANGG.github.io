I am a PhD student in the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) at NYU [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), working with Prof. [Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/) and Prof. [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/). I'm interested in reasoning, planning and multimodal learning.

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Data Science at NYU as well and a BS in Computer Science, Statistics, and Finance at McGill University.
