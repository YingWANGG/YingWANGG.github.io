I am a first-year PhD student at NYU [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andrew Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/) and [Prof. Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/) in the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/). My primary research interest is multimodal learning, and I aim to build systems that can emulate human-like perception by seamlessly integrating various modalities such as text, images, videos, and audio. 

Prior to moving to New York, I studied Computer Science, Statistics, and Finance at McGill University in Montreal, Canada üçÅ
