I am a recent MSDS graduate from New York University's Center for Data Science, where I researched vision-language representation learning under the supervision of [Prof. Yann LeCun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WLN3QrAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/). Prior to this, I studied Computer Science, Statistics, and Finance at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

My primary research interest lies in building systems that can emulate human-like perception by seamlessly integrating various modalities such as text, audio, images, and videos. I also remain open to delving into novel areas within machine learning that captivate my curiosity, given that I am still in the early stage of my research journey. Presently, I am looking for PhD opportunities for the year 2024.
