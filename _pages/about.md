I am an incoming PhD student at NYU [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Andrew Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/) and [Prof. Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/). I received my MSDS at NYU as well. Prior to moving to New York, I studied Computer Science, Statistics, and Finance at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

My primary research interest is multimodal learning. Specifically, I aim to build systems that can emulate human-like perception by seamlessly integrating various modalities such as text, images, videos and audio.
